"""A golden episode on each sandbox provider whose credential is present here.

The golden agent is the task's own reference solution, executed by the
connector, so no GPU, no model and no session server take part: what a pass
proves is exactly the platform round trip -- template/image resolution,
sandbox create, exec, verifier, teardown. Offline tests cannot see that layer,
and ``test_harbor_rollout.py`` covers the layers above it.

This drives ``scripts/sandbox_smoke/run.py``, which stays the one definition of
what a golden run is and the entry point for the combinations CI does not fix:
another agent harness, another task, another connector. All this adds is the CI
half -- one case per provider in ``PROVIDER_CREDENTIALS``, each skipped unless
this machine has that provider's credential and SDK. So a provider whose
credential CI does not hold reports as a skip, and starts running the day it
does, with no test change. A case that does run creates a real sandbox and
spends real quota, so pick with ``-k`` when you hold several credentials:

    PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest tests/e2e/agentic/test_sandbox_golden.py -v
    PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest tests/e2e/agentic/test_sandbox_golden.py -k modal

Each provider's credential, endpoint variables and install line are documented
on ``PROVIDER_CREDENTIALS``; which combinations have been run is recorded in
``scripts/sandbox_smoke/README.md``.
